Course Planning System
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a course planning system in C++. The system allows users to load course data from a file, display course lists, and retrieve information about specific courses.

Project Structure
project1: Contains the pseudocode and analysis for Project One, which focuses on designing the course planning system and analyzing runtime and memory characteristics of different data structures.
project2: Contains the C++ implementation of Project Two, which involves the actual coding of the course planning system.
Project One Analysis
In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory characteristics of three data structures: Vector, Hashtable, and Tree. After considering their advantages and disadvantages, I concluded that Hashtable is the most suitable data structure for storing and retrieving course data efficiently.

Project Two Implementation
Project Two involves the actual coding of the course planning system. It includes functionalities such as loading course data from a file, displaying course lists, and retrieving course information. The system is designed to be modular, maintainable, and user-friendly.

Reflection
Problem: The primary problem addressed in these projects is the development of a course planning system to help users manage and navigate course data effectively.
Approach: I approached the problem by first analyzing different data structures to determine the most suitable one for the task. Then, I designed pseudocode to outline the system's functionalities and implemented the system in C++.
Challenges: Addressing file I/O errors and ensuring proper validation of course data format were significant challenges. However, thorough testing and error handling helped overcome these obstacles.
Learnings: Working on these projects expanded my understanding of data structures, problem-solving skills, and software design principles. It taught me the importance of modularity, readability, and error handling in software development.
Evolution: These projects have evolved my approach to designing software by emphasizing the significance of clean, maintainable, and adaptable code. I now strive to write code that is not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain for myself and others.
Next Steps
Implement additional features such as course search and enrollment functionality.
Enhance error handling and user input validation for a more robust system.
Explore optimization techniques to improve system performance, especially for handling large datasets.
